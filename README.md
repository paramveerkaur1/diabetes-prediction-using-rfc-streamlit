# Diabetes Prediction using Random Forest Classifier and Streamlit

This Diabetes Predictor leverages Random Forest Classification Model to predict diabetes risk based on individual medical history and demographic information. 
By analyzing factors such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level,
this application assists healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of developing diabetes. 

It uses Streamlit to create a web application that can be used to make predictions by entering the patient details and obtaining results.
